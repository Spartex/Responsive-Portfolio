         <p>    My name is John Comodikes (Pronounced COMO-DEE-KIS).
                I am originally born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa!
                
                <br>

                I currently live in Southern California in a city called Riverside! I currently work for the County of Riverside and have been in the IT Industry for over 10 years!
                
                <br>
                
                <p>I have worked from sales, to owning my own business, and now for the Government.
                My love for technology entices me to reach new heights and to learn new skills.

                <br>
                
                I am very grateful for the experience I have gained throughout my years, and look forward to what the future holds.
                I enjoy learning to code, build and collect computer parts, as well as, reading up on new technologies. My hopes are to transition my career into being a Full Stack Web Developer
                full time.

            </p>
